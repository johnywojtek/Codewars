# CodeWars

This is the GitHub repository where I save copies of the katas I've completed on [codewars.com](https://www.codewars.com/).

## What is CodeWars?

It's a cool website where you face challenges and you get leveled by how good you do. It isn't limited to JavaScript or any or the languages you can find in this repo, it even has Kotlin!

## Leveling System

## Ranks

Ranks are used to indicate progression and difficulty. Code Warriors complete Kata which are assigned a rank, which in turn earns them a higher rank once they complete enough of them. You begin with Kyu at level 8 and work your way down to level 1.
